Resource plugins enable interaction with and management of various infrastructure resources. These plugins can list, create, update, delete, and watch resources, providing a seamless interface for infrastructure management within Omniview.

{{< alert context="warning" text="Omniview is under heavy active development - the `ResourcePlugin` SDK is subject to frequent breaking changes until the first stable release." />}}
